    <string name="introduce_detials">1. BixinKey is a hardware wallet for Bitcoin, where private keys will never have internet exposure \n 2. BixinKey is open-source \n 3. BixinKey has a display so that payment can be confirmed both ways, making your assets safer \n 4. BixinKey\'s card like design is more user friendly, making it easier to use or to keep \n 5. BixinKey uses military level chips \n 6. BixinKey does not support private key export. If you do not need multiple signers, you can set 1-of-2 multi-sig; so when a BixinKey is lost, you can use the backup BixinKey for transactions or asset transfers \n 7. We advise you to buy more than 2 BixinKeys, purchase address</string>

    <string name="user_agreement_content">"\t\t\t\t This Agreement is a contract between you (hereinafter referred to as the "User") and Bixin Global Co,. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the "Bixin"), the owner of the Bixin official platform (including web, mobile and applications, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Platform") for matters related to the Cold Storage service of Bixin, which is legally binding on the User and Bixin. In particular, Bixin reminds the User to carefully read and fully understand the provisions of this Agreement, especially the provisions in this Agreement relating to the exemption or limitation of the Platform liability and the exclusion or limitation of User rights. The User shall read it carefully and choose to accept or not accept this Agreement. Unless the User accepts all the provisions of this Agreement, the User shall not have the right to use the services provided by the Platform based on this Agreement. If the User does not agree with the content of this Agreement or refuses to recognize the right of the Platform to unilaterally modify this Agreement at any time, the User shall immediately stop using and no longer access this Platform. The User\'s use of the Platform services (including but not limited to use, browsing, etc.) shall be deemed to be a full understanding and full acceptance of all the provisions of this Agreement (including any changes made to this Agreement at any time by Bixin), and this Agreement shall enter into force immediately. In addition to this Agreement, the User shall abide by other agreements and rules announced by the Platform, including but not limited to, license agreements, privacy policies, after-sales service policies and legal statements, and other agreements, rules, announcements, statements, instructions or guidelines that have been or may be issued on the Platform (including amendments from time to time, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Rules").
        \n<font color="#000000"><b>I.  DEFINITION</b></font>
        \n I.1 “This Agreement” refers to this User Service Agreement and its amendments from time to time.
        \n I.2 "Cold Storage" refers to the hardware products that realize the secure storage of digital assets based on hierarchical deterministic (HD) technology. Cold Storage uses two technical schemes to generate Private Keys in different currencies, one is to randomly generate seed passwords and set Payment Passwords, and the seed passwords are combined with Payment Passwords to generate Private Keys in different currencies. The other is to generate Mnemonic words randomly, and the Private Keys of different currencies are generated by Mnemonic words. Finally, the Public Key is generated by the Private Key, and the asset address is generated by the Public Key to realize the secure storage of digital assets.
        \n I.3 "Hot Storage" refers to digital asset storages developed based on blockchain, including other auxiliary tools developed to facilitate User to use blockchain systems.
        \n I.4 "Public key" refers to the one-way derivation of the Private Key with the help of the principle of cryptography, and is used to generate the blockchain digital storage address, which is the public collection address.
        \n I.5 "Private key" refers to a 256-bit random character, which is the key for users to own and use digital assets.
        \n I.6 "Mnemonic Word" refers to the 12 (or 15/18/21/24) ordered words generated by a random algorithm that comply with the blockchain BIP39 industry standard. It is an easy-to-record expression of the Private Key, which is convenient for User to backup and keep.
        \n I.7 "Payment Password" refers to a password that the User should set during the process of creating a storage, which will be used in conjunction with the seed password to generate a currency Private Key. This password cannot be modified, and once the User loses or forgets the password, the asset will not be recovered.
        \n I.8 "Security Password" refers to a password that the User should set during the process of creating a storage, which will be used to protect the Private Key. The Security Password is not stored in the User\'s mobile device or the Platform server, and once the User forgets the password, it will not be recovered. The User can use the Private Key or Mnemonic Word to re-import the storage and set a new Security Password.
        \n<font color="#000000"><b>II.  PLATFORM SERVICES </b></font>
        \n II.1 The User can choose to use different language versions of the Platform. If the content of different language versions of the Platform is inconsistent or conflicting, or if the content is omitted, the Chinese version of the Platform should be given priority.
        \n II.2 The Platform is a digital assets security management service platform, which is provided by Bixin to the User. The specific services mainly include: digital assets security management services, user services and other auxiliary services. The details are based on the actual service content provided by the Platform.
        \n II.3 For the User to access or use the Platform service, the Users must be equipped with Internet equipment needed to access the Internet, and bear the costs of this service, including not limited to network access fees, mobile phone traffic fees, and so on. When it comes to the use of any third-party services, the User shall also comply with the third-party service guidelines and related fees.
        \n II.4 In the course of the implementation of this Agreement, Bixin may modify this Agreement according to the circumstances. In the event of any change in the content of this agreement, Bixin will announce the latest service agreement and will no longer give individual notice to the User. If the User does not agree with the changes made by Bixin to this agreement, the User has the right to stop using the Platform services. If the User continues to use the Platform services, the User shall be deemed to have accepted the changes made by Bixin to this Agreement and shall be carried out in accordance with the revised agreement.
        \n II.5 Bixin with respect to the User\'s notice and any other agreements, rules, notices or other notices about the User\'s use of the service, the User agrees that Bixin may be carried out by electronic or physical means such as Platform announcements, internal letters, e-mails, mobile phone text messages, etc., and such notices shall be deemed to have been served on the recipient on the date of sending such notices (if a notice is sent to the user by post). The notices shall be deemed to have been served on the third natural day after the notices have been mailed in accordance with the contact address left by the User on the Platform. If the User fails to receive the foregoing notice on the date when it is deemed to have been served due to reasons that are not attributable to Bixin (including inaccurate or invalid e-mail address, mobile phone number, contact address, information transmission failure, etc.), Bixin shall not bear any responsibility.
        \n II.6 In order to avoid any misoperation of asset storages or any security risks to digital assets as far as possible, the User should avoid using Platform services without basic knowledge of blockchain. For the User who does not have the basic knowledge of blockchain, Bixin has the right to refuse to provide some or all of the service functions.
        \n II.7 The User understands that Bixin will modify, suspend or completely shut down the Platform service under the following circumstances, and the effective date shall be subject to the Platform announcement, and the User agrees that Bixin shall not bear any liability for breach of contract or compensation or compensation to the User as a result:
        \n\t\t（1）the operation of the Platform is interrupted due to technical reasons such as equipment, block chain system maintenance, upgrade, failure and communication interruption;
        \n\t\t（2）due to force majeure and other factors, the Platform is unable to provide services or it is reasonable to believe that there is a greater risk of continuing to provide services;
        \n\t\t（3）where there is a major adverse change in the applicable law or policy, or in accordance with the requirements of the laws, regulations, rules, orders and other norms of the sovereign country or region to which the User belongs;
        \n\t\t（4）for the legitimate interests of protecting the interests of the Platform or Users;
        \n\t\t（5）other circumstances beyond the control of the Platform or reasonably foreseen.
        \n<font color="#000000"><b>III.  CONTENT OF SERVICES</b></font>
        \n III.1 Storage Creation
        \n\t\t（1）When the User creates the storage for the first time, this Agreement will pop up. Once the User agrees to create the storage, it means that the User agrees to all the contents of this Agreement, and the User is bound by this Agreement. If the User does not have the subject qualification required by this Agreement, the User shall bear all the consequences, and Bixin reserves the right to hold the User accountable.
        \n\t\t（2）The User hereby undertakes to create the storage and use the Platform services for legitimate purposes, and does not have the intention to violate the laws and regulations through the Platform or the Platform services; the User warrants that the digital assets deposited in the storage are of legitimate source; except for this Agreement, the User shall at the same time abide by all rules issued and updated by the Platform from time to time, including announcements, instructions for the use of procedures, risk tips, etc.
        \n III.2 User Services Provided By The Platform

        \n\t\t（2）Adhering to the decentralized characteristics of the blockchain, and in order to protect the security of Users digital assets, the Platform provides decentralized services, which are different from banking financial institutions. The User understands and accepts that the Platform does not bear the following responsibilities: storing the User\'s Security Password (that is, the password set by the User when creating/importing the storage), Private Key, Mnemonic Word, retrieving the User\'s Security Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Word, freezing the storage, reporting the loss of the storage, recovering the storage, etc.
        \n\t\t（3）The User shall bear the responsibility of keeping mobile devices containing asset storages, backing up storage information, backing up Security Passwords, Mnemonic Word and Private Keys. If the User loses the mobile device, deletes and does not back up the storage information, deletes and does not back up the storage, the storage is stolen or forgets the Security Password, Private Key and Mnemonic Word, the Platform cannot restore the storage or retrieve the Security Ppassword, Private Key and Mnemonic Word; if the User misoperates during the transaction (for example, the wrong transfer address, the wrong transfer amount), the Platform cannot cancel the transaction, and the Platform shall not bear any responsibility for it.
        \n III.3 Cold Storage Products
        \n\t\t（1）The product information released by the Platform may change at any time, therefore, Bixin may modify and adjust the text expression and picture effect in the Platform page in real time. Bixin will make reasonable commercial efforts to make the product specification parameters, function description, parts information, inventory, restricted quantity and other product information displayed in the Platform as accurate, detailed and matched with the actual product information as much as possible. However, due to the huge amount of product information on the Platform, and limited by the development level of network technology, product batches and real-time changes in production and supply factors and other factors, the Platform does not rule out the possibility that some of the information will lag or make errors.
        \n\t\t（2）The Platform clearly marks the price of the product, but the User should understand and agree that the product price information of Bixin may change at any time, because the transaction price of the product must be based on the price of the order submitted by the User confirmed by Bixin. At the same time, although Bixin will do its best to ensure the accuracy of the price of the goods on the Platform, there may still be mispricing of some goods, and Bixin reserves the right not to confirm or cancel the corresponding order for the goods with obvious mispricing.
        \n\t\t（3）When the User places an order, the User needs to carefully confirm the name, price, quantity, model, specification, size, contact address, telephone number, consignee and other information of the product purchased. If the consignee is inconsistent with the User, the behavior and expression of intention of the consignee shall be regarded as the behavior and expression of intention of the User, and the User shall be responsible for the legal consequences of the act and expression of intention of the consignee.
        \n\t\t（4）The successful order submission is only the data automatically generated by the computer information system according to the content you fill in, and it is only the transaction request sent by the User to Bixin, not the promise of Bixin to the order placed by the User. After receiving the order information from the User, only when the order placed by the User is confirmed by actual action or explicit intention (such as sending a text message confirming the order to the User, e-mail confirming the order) or when the product ordered by the User is actually sent directly to the User from the warehouse (marked by the product leaving the warehouse), it is considered that a transaction relationship has been established between the User and Bixin on the product that is actually directly confirmed or sent directly to the User. The User can log in to the Platform at any time to query the order status.
        \n\t\t（5）Bixin or the seller authorized by Bixin will send the product to the receiving address specified by the User, and all the delivery time listed on the Platform is the reference time. The reference time is estimated on the basis of inventory status, normal processing process, delivery time and delivery location. Bixin or its authorized seller shall not bear any responsibility to the User or consignee for the difference between the actual delivery time and the delivery time displayed on the Platform.
